Code: # ellpack

The provided HLS code is written in C and defines a function called `ellpack` with the following signature:
- Function: `void ellpack(double nzval[4940], int cols[4940], double vec[494], double out[494])`
- Parameters:
  - `nzval`: array of double with 4940 elements
  - `cols`: array of int with 4940 elements
  - `vec`: array of double with 494 elements
  - `out`: array of double with 494 elements

The overall process of the code involves performing an operation on the input arrays `nzval`, `cols`, `vec`, and producing an output array `out`. The specific computation involves nested loops where the outer loop iterates 494 times and the inner loop iterates 10 times. During each iteration, it performs arithmetic operations and updates the `out` array.

The code contains several `#pragma` directives, which are HLS-specific directives for guiding hardware synthesis:
- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{flatten}`: Automatically pipeline the loop to facilitate parallel execution. Loop iteration dependencies will be resolved during synthesis.
- `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{8}`: Divide the loop into smaller parts, each containing 8 iterations. This enables parallelization at a smaller granularity.
- `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{2}`: Execute loop iterations concurrently by a factor of 2. This enables parallel execution of the loop to increase throughput.

Additionally, the code also contains the `#pragma ACCEL kernel` directive, which designates the `ellpack` function for hardware acceleration.

In summary, the `ellpack` function processes input arrays through nested loops and applies hardware-specific directives to optimize synthesis for parallel execution and pipeline stages.
