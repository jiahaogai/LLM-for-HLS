Code: #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`:
  - Translation: Do not automatically pipeline this loop.
  - Explanation: This pragma directive ensures that the loop specified (`stencil_label14`) is not automatically divided into smaller parts for parallel execution. Each iteration of the loop will be executed sequentially without pipelining.

- `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}`:
  - Translation: Keep this loop whole, without dividing it into smaller parts.
  - Explanation: This pragma directive indicates that the loop specified (`stencil_label14`) should not be tiled or divided into smaller sub-loops. It will remain intact, processing data in its entirety without partitioning.

- `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}`:
  - Translation: Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently.
  - Explanation: This pragma directive ensures that the loop specified (`stencil_label14`) is not parallelized. Each iteration will be executed sequentially, one after another, without concurrent execution.

- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`:
  - Translation: Do not automatically pipeline this loop.
  - Explanation: This pragma directive ensures that the loop specified (`stencil_label15`) is not automatically divided into smaller parts for parallel execution. Each iteration of the loop will be executed sequentially without pipelining.
