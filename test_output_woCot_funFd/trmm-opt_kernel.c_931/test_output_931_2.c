Code: #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=B FACTOR=auto{8}`: Perform a parallel reduction operation on the array `B` with a factor of 8 to improve parallelism and reduce computation time.
6. `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=B FACTOR=auto{8} SIZE=80`: Perform a parallel reduction operation on the array `B` with a factor of 8 to improve parallelism and reduce computation time. The reduction region is specified through SIZE and the reduction operation starts at B[0][60].
7. `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`: Do not automatically pipeline this loop to avoid overlapping computation and memory access.
8. `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{2}`: Divide this loop into two parts, one of them whoose size is 16 rows, and the other of them whoose size is 48 rows. This allows the memory traffic to be more balanced.
9. `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}`: Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently, to avoid data dependencies.
10. `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{flatten}`: Flatten this loop to avoid a possible pipeline overflow.
11. `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{8}`: Keep this loop whole, without dividing it into smaller parts, for efficient memory access.
12. `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}`: Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently, to avoid data dependencies.
13. `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`: Do not automatically pipeline this loop to avoid overlapping computation and memory access.
