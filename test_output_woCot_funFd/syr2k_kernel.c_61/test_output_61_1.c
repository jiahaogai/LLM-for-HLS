- The middle loop is not automatically pipelined to maximize performance.
- The middle loop is kept whole without division into smaller parts to maintain data locality.
- Loop iterations of the middle loop are executed sequentially, ensuring correct dependencies are observed.
- The inner loop is automatically flattened for better performance.
- The inner loop is tiled with a factor of 80, meaning it is divided into 80 smaller parts.
- Loop iterations of the inner loop are executed in parallel, overlapping computation and communication.
