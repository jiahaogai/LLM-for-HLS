- Automatically pipeline the inner loop for hardware acceleration.
- Divide the inner loop into tiles of size 1 for efficient hardware resource utilization.
- Execute the inner loop iterations in parallel with a factor of 1 for concurrent processing on hardware.
- Apply the following stencil computation: -1  -1  -1  -1  2  2  2  -1  -1  -1  -1 ...
- Adjust the bounds in order to avoid the array index out of bounds errors.
