8. `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}`
   - Translation: Keep this loop whole, without dividing it into smaller parts.
   - Explanation: Specifies that the innermost loop (`stencil_label3`) should not be tiled, similar to the middle loop, ensuring it executes as a single, continuous loop.

9. `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}`
   - Translation: Execute loop iterations in parallel.
   - Explanation: Indicates that loop iterations within the innermost loop (`stencil_label3`) should be executed in parallel for optimal throughput.
