- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{flatten}`:
     - Explanation: Automatically pipeline this loop, and flatten it if possible, which means optimizing the loop structure for hardware acceleration.
   
   - `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{2}`:
     - Explanation: Keep this loop whole without dividing it into smaller parts, and use a tile factor of 2 if applicable, which optimizes memory access patterns.
   
   - `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{19}`:
     - Explanation: Execute loop iterations concurrently, with a parallel factor of 19 if possible, to maximize hardware parallelism and improve performance.
