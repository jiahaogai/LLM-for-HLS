8. `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`  
   - **Translation:** Do not automatically pipeline this loop.
   - **Explanation:** Disables automatic pipelining for the innermost loop, likely to manage resource utilization or timing constraints.

9. `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}`  
   - **Translation:** Keep this loop whole, without dividing it into smaller parts.
   - **Explanation:** Instructs the compiler not to partition the loop further, likely because the loop's overhead outweighs the benefits of parallelization.

10. `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}`  
    - **Translation:** Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently.
    - **Explanation:** Despite the parallelization directive, this pragma specifies that loop iterations should be executed sequentially, likely due to dependencies within the loop body.
