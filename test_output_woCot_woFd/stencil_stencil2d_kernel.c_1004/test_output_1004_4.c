- The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{}` directive instructs the compiler to automatically pipeline the loops for optimization.

- The `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}` directive keeps the loops whole without dividing them into smaller parts.

- The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{32}` directive executes loop iterations concurrently, with a parallelization factor of 32.

- The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{flatten}` directive instructs the compiler to automatically flatten the loop for pipeline optimization.

- The `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}` directive keeps the loop whole without dividing it into smaller parts.

- The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{16}` directive executes loop iterations concurrently, with a parallelization factor of 16.

- The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}` directive instructs the compiler to not automatically pipeline this loop for optimization.
