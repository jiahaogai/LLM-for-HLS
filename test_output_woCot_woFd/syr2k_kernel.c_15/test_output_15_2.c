- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{}` - Automatically pipeline the loop iterations to maximize parallelism.
- `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{8}` - Divide the loop into tiles of size 8 to optimize memory access and parallel processing.
- `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{10}` - Execute loop iterations concurrently in parallel with a factor of 10 to maximize hardware resource utilization. Within this pragma, further sub-directives are included:
  - `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}` - Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently, with a factor of 1.
  - `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{}` - Automatically pipeline the loop iterations to maximize parallelism.
  - `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}` - Keep the loop whole, without dividing it into smaller parts.
  - `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}` - Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently, with a factor of 1.
  - `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{8}` - Execute loop iterations concurrently in parallel with a factor of 8 to maximize hardware resource utilization.
