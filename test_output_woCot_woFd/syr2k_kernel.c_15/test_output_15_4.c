- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{}` - Automatically pipeline the loop iterations to maximize parallelism.
  - `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{8}` - Divide the loop into tiles of size 8 to optimize memory access and parallel processing.
  - `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{10}` - Execute loop iterations concurrently in parallel with a factor of 10 to maximize hardware resource utilization.
