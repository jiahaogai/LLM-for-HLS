8. `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}`: Keep the loop (`stencil_label3`) whole without dividing it into smaller parts, likely to maintain data locality.
9. `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}`: Execute loop iterations of the loop (`stencil_label3`) sequentially, not concurrently, to ensure correct data dependencies.
