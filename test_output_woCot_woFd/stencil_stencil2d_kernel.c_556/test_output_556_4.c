- **#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}**:
  - Translation: "Do not automatically pipeline this loop."
  - Explanation: This directive disables automatic loop pipelining, indicating that the loop should not be parallelized without manual optimization.

- **#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{2}**:
  - Translation: "Keep this loop whole, without dividing it into smaller parts, and use a tile factor of 2."
  - Explanation: This directive instructs the HLS tool to use a tiling optimization with a factor of 2, allowing for efficient memory access patterns.

- **#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}**:
  - Translation: "Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently, with a parallel factor of 1."
  - Explanation: This directive specifies that loop iterations should be executed sequentially rather than in parallel, ensuring correct data dependencies are maintained.

- **#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{flatten}**:
  - Translation: "Automatically pipeline this loop and flatten it."
  - Explanation: This directive enables automatic loop pipelining and flattens the loop, which can improve throughput by allowing multiple loop iterations to be processed simultaneously.

- **#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}**:
  - Translation: "Keep this loop whole, without dividing it into smaller parts, and use a tile factor of 1."
  - Explanation: Similar to the previous tile directive, this instructs the HLS tool to keep the loop intact and use a tile factor of 1, potentially optimizing memory access patterns.

- **#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{4}**:
  - Translation: "Execute loop iterations concurrently, with a parallel factor of 4."
  - Explanation: This directive parallelizes the loop, allowing up to 4 loop iterations to be executed simultaneously, which can improve performance on hardware accelerators.

- **#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}**:
  - Translation: "Do not automatically pipeline this loop."
  - Explanation: This directive disables automatic loop pipelining, indicating that the loop should not be parallelized without manual optimization.
