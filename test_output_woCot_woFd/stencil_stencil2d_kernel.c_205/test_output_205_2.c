- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`:
  - Translation: "Do not automatically pipeline this loop."
  - Explanation: This pragma directive instructs the compiler not to automatically parallelize the loop, allowing manual control over the pipelining process.

- `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{126}`:
  - Translation: "Keep this loop whole, without dividing it into smaller parts."
  - Explanation: This pragma directive specifies the loop tiling factor, indicating how the loop should be partitioned for optimization. In this case, it suggests keeping the loop as a whole without dividing it into smaller tiles.

- `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}`:
  - Translation: "Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently."
  - Explanation: This pragma directive controls loop parallelization. Setting the factor to 1 indicates that loop iterations should be executed sequentially rather than in parallel, potentially for optimization purposes.

- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`:
  - Translation: "Do not automatically pipeline this loop."
  - Explanation: This pragma directive instructs the compiler not to automatically parallelize the loop, allowing manual control over the pipelining process.
