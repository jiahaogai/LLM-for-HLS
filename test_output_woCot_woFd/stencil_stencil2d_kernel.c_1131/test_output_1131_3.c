- `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}`: Keep the loop (`stencil_label3`) whole without dividing it into smaller parts to maintain data locality.
- `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{8}`: Execute the loop (`stencil_label3`) iterations concurrently with a parallel factor of 8 to exploit parallelism and accelerate computation.
