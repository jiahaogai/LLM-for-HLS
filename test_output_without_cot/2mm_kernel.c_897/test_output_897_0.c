Within the third loop:
- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`: Do not automatically pipeline the loop.
- `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}`: Keep the loop as a whole without dividing it into smaller parts.
- `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{2}`: Execute loop iterations in parallel with a concurrency factor of 2.

Within the fourth loop:
- `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{off}`: Do not automatically pipeline the loop.
- `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{1}`: Keep the loop as a whole without dividing it into smaller parts.
- `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{1}`: Execute loop iterations sequentially, not concurrently.
