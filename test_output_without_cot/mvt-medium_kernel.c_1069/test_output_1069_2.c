8. `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction = x2 FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}`:  
   **Explanation:** This directive specifies that the loop should be parallelized and that the reduction operation for array `x2` should be performed in parallel with a factor of auto{__PARA__L2}.

9. `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}`:  
   **Explanation:** This directive specifies that the pipeline should be flattened, possibly resulting in a higher initiation interval to improve resource utilization.

10. `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}`:  
    **Explanation:** This directive specifies that the loop should be divided into tiles of size auto{__TILE__L2} for parallel execution.

11. `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}`:  
    **Explanation:** This directive specifies that loop iterations should be executed in parallel with a factor of auto{__PARA__L2}.
